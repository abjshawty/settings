# Settings

This is a collection of scripts that i use in my daily life. These scripts are used to streamline my different processes so i don't have to remember everything all the time.

Do not clone this to a shared workstation, as it contains much private data.

## Using it

Find your $Profile file via powershell, then paste:
```
. C:\Users\othniel.kouadio\dev\settings\powershell\profile.ps1
```

Every new powershell instance will now load the scripts on launch.

## To do list

- [ ] Add SSH to AGPAIEMS server
